   - Keep DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md open while coding
   - Copy code patterns from examples

2. **Follow Conventions:**
   - Use spacing scale consistently
   - Import theme system in every screen/component
   - Apply typography from system

3. **Understand Before Modifying:**
   - Read ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL.md before changing data flow
   - Check PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md before adding new screens

4. **Test Design Changes:**
   - Verify on multiple device sizes
   - Check color contrast (WCAG AA)
   - Test both light and dark scenarios

5. **Keep It Consistent:**
   - Never hardcode colors, spacing, or typography
